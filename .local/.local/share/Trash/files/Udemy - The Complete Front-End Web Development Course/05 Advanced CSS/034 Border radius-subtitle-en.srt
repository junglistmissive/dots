1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,390
Alright, so, how do we make things round? Well, that's a great question, and it's

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:12,330
not really, I mean it's kind of relevant

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:12,330
because you can still use it for a lot

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:18,210
of things, but round web design is

5
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:18,210
something from the early 2000s and we're

6
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,930
gonna stay away from that as much as

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,930
possible, which means hard corners or

8
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:28,170
a very small amount of roundness on the

9
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:28,170
corners. And so what I'm gonna start

10
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:34,710
working with is the input here, let's say

11
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:34,710
I want to have slightly rounded corners

12
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:43,800
on this input. I'm gonna use the border-radius property, and if you only

13
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:50,670
supply one value to this property

14
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:50,670
it affects all the corners. So I'm gonna

15
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:59,340
say three pixels. Save it and refresh, and

16
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:59,340
now when we set the border radius we

17
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:06,030
also need to set the border to fix the

18
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:06,030
fact that it's reverting to an older

19
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:17,810
state. So let's set border one pixel

20
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:17,810
solid, sort of a gray color, there we go.

21
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:22,470
So there's our rounded corners and you

22
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:22,470
might not be able to see them that well,

23
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:29,490
so I'm gonna make them bigger. Let's go

24
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:29,490
with ten pixel border radius, and this is

25
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:35,040
gonna make them quite round. Now this

26
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:35,040
reminds me of the search input field

27
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:41,070
on Twitter. I'm not sure if it still

28
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:41,070
looks like that but it used to a long

29
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:45,659
time ago, and Facebook as well. Things

30
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:45,659
have straightened out quite a bit in web

31
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:51,780
design, so I'm not sure if this is still

32
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:51,780
the state of those things, but that's how

33
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,369
to use border radius, in a nutshell.

34
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,369
Usually if you're going to be making

35
00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:03,180
anything round, or the edges of something

36
00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:03,180
round, you're going to be

37
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:09,629
applying it to all sides. Now you don't

38
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:09,629
need a border for the border radius to

39
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:13,510
work. So I'm going to

40
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:13,510
this to transparent. And that's another

41
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:19,120
thing, transparent is a valid color. It's

42
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:19,120
not a hex color or RGBA so you're not

43
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,750
you know putting it in any specific

44
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,750
format, it's the word, it's a key word,

45
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:26,380
you're just gonna type transparent. This

46
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:26,380
will apply to setting the background

47
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:32,040
color of something, setting the color of

48
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:32,040
the text if you really want to, but

49
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,370
that's up to you. I'm gonna save this and

50
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,370
refresh, and now you'll see there's no

51
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:39,910
border, but when I click into it we still

52
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:39,910
have the border apply there. So I'm

53
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:46,180
actually gonna remove that. Focus let's

54
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:46,180
say just remove that all together.

55
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:50,740
Save it, refresh it, and there you

56
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:50,740
go. You can see the border radius still

57
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:55,060
affects this even without a border, so

58
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:55,060
it's basically the element itself. It's

59
00:02:55,060 --> 00:03:02,820
kind of like an element radius, but I

60
00:02:55,060 --> 00:03:02,820
guess we call it a border radius. Now,

61
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:09,310
reset that border so that we can see what

62
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:09,310
we're doing here. I'm gonna supply it two

63
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:15,100
arguments 10 pixels and then 20 pixels,

64
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:15,100
and what you'll see is it's kind of

65
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:21,100
offset. So the top left becomes the 10

66
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:21,100
pixels, the top right becomes 20 pixels,

67
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:25,840
the bottom right becomes 20 pixels, or the bottom left, and the

68
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,090
bottom right is 10, and so think of it

69
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,090
like counter, or clockwise. So we're

70
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:39,360
setting 10, 20, 10, 20. That's how

71
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:39,360
that works. Now you can also supply four

72
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,690
arguments. So on the second one I'm going to say two pixels, and then the last one

73
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,989
it's gonna be really big at fifty

74
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,989
pixels so that we can really see which

75
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:57,640
side it effects. So as you can see, this

76
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:57,640
is 10, 20, 5, and 50. It's a clockwise circle

77
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:01,840
that you're going around when you're

78
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:01,840
defining these. Now, something else that is

79
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,620
going to confuse things, and we need to

80
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,620
do it on a bigger element so we're gonna

81
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:12,370
be doing it on the on the image here,

82
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:12,370
let's use the image, yeah we're going to

83
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:20,350
use the image there. So, you can set two,

84
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:20,350
you can set each corner to have its own

85
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:25,220
border radius property, and you can set

86
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:25,220
two values if you're doing it that way.

87
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:31,190
So the image right here, I need to go

88
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:31,190
find out how we should target that, it's

89
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:35,750
not an image it's a class of article

90
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:35,750
image right there. So I'm gonna jump over

91
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:43,910
to my stylesheet and target the class

92
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:43,910
article-image, it's gonna work really

93
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:52,360
well if I spell it correctly. What we're

94
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:52,360
gonna say is border-top-left-radius, and

95
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:57,280
again it's CSS so every word is

96
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:57,280
separated by a dash and it's all lowercase.

97
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,150
border-top-left-radius, you can do

98
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,150
border-top-right-radius, border-bottom-left-radius,

99
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:06,350
etc. So I'm gonna set first just one value in

100
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:11,660
here so you guys can see what happens. As you can probably assume, it's just going

101
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:20,150
to change that one border radius, but

102
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:20,150
we're going to apply two values here, and

103
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:25,880
what's gonna happen is the first one is

104
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:25,880
the top edge, yeah first one

105
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:32,210
is the top edge right about to the

106
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:32,210
corner itself, and then the second value

107
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:39,640
is the left edge. See it kind of bends

108
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:39,640
here and then it gets more gradual, and

109
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:48,530
that's supplying two arguments to it. Now

110
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:48,530
let's set it even bigger. Now you can see

111
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:52,220
it really well.

112
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:52,220
So, if we were going from the center of

113
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:57,980
the element to the corner it would be

114
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:57,980
about here, and so you can see on the

115
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:03,830
left hand side it's starting to, I think I

116
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:03,830
set it to 20 pixels or 50 pixels, so

117
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:08,300
it's doing a 50 pixel border radius,

118
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:08,300
and it gets here and it's like oh, let's

119
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:14,840
switch to 100, and it gets more

120
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:14,840
gradual as it goes. I can't think of any

121
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:20,780
point this specific application would be

122
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:20,780
relevant, especially in web design where

123
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:25,160
things are getting more straight edged

124
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:25,160
and hard corners, but if you ever feel

125
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:31,900
like using this that's how to use two

126
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:31,900
values in each border radius declaration.

127
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:38,390
Now one final thing, you can easily make

128
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:38,390
something that has equal width and

129
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:41,570
height a circle. So what I'm going to do is this

130
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:50,350
article image right here, I'm going to

131
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:50,350
set it to height 200 pixels and width

132
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:58,580
200 pixels, and then I'm going to set

133
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:58,580
border radius 100%. Save it

134
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:04,009
and refresh, and what happens is it

135
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:04,009
becomes a full circle because each of

136
00:07:04,009 --> 00:07:12,949
these edges I guess begin to turn right

137
00:07:04,009 --> 00:07:12,949
towards the other point where it can

138
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:17,720
then you know create a radius to the

139
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:17,720
next point, and it keeps going. So that's

140
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:27,220
100%, but you can also set

141
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:27,220
it to a full pixel, 100 pixel. Save it,

142
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:31,580
refresh, and it's still going to be a

143
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:31,580
circle, and that's because the width and

144
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:37,220
height is 200, so we could actually split

145
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:37,220
it down to 50 pixels, and that's 1/4, and

146
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:44,620
it should...no, sorry, 100 because it's half the height and then half the width, and

147
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:50,660
that's exactly what we're working with

148
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:50,660
to get it from this point right here, to

149
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:54,550
the top point, that's 100 pixels up and a

150
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:54,550
100 pixels right, so it's a 100

151
00:07:54,550 --> 00:08:02,510
pixels. So that's border radius, that's

152
00:07:54,550 --> 00:08:02,510
gonna be fun, and using circles to make

153
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:09,289
an element circular, that's when the

154
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:09,289
border radius is most used, at least by

155
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:13,970
me. I don't really make things rounded

156
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:13,970
that much, but we'll get more into that

157
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:22,789
later. In the next video, I think we

158
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:22,789
