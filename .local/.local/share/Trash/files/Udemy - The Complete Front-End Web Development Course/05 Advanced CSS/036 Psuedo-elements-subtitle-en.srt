1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,570
Alright guys. So we've already learned

2
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,570
about a lot of different elements, and

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:07,560
I'm sure that's a lot of information

4
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:07,560
that you're going to have to find a way

5
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:17,340
to retain. For the most part, the

6
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:17,340
syntax is really easy to learn when

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:23,430
it comes to CSS and HTML. It's the

8
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:23,430
specifics that you really need to

9
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:29,900
practice. Which specific elements like

10
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:29,900
a video element, a div, a span, and then also

11
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:35,760
CSS properties or attributes, and that's

12
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:35,760
border-bottom, or position, as seen here.

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,930
Those are the things that you're going

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,930
to need to really hammer away on in

15
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:46,590
order to retain all this information. So,

16
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:46,590
with that set and out of the way, there's

17
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:51,090
a gray area here where an element

18
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:51,090
doesn't really exist, but we can make it

19
00:00:51,090 --> 00:01:00,840
exist if we want to, and that's before

20
00:00:51,090 --> 00:01:00,840
and after. So, the main header here, it has

21
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:07,560
a before and after, there's a partial

22
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:07,560
element before it and an element after

23
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,540
it, and they're not visible, and they're not

24
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,540
used unless we actually use it ourselves.

25
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,880
So let's go ahead and say main-header,

26
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,880
we're gonna put two colons, and gonna say

27
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:26,729
before. Now this creates a blank element

28
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:26,729
that didn't exist before now, it has no

29
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:32,070
default styles, it has no properties

30
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:32,070
assigned by default, so that's where we

31
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:39,659
need to start defining the content. So,

32
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:39,659
content is a property that we're

33
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:44,340
generally not going to use except for

34
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:44,340
right here, and it's going to be blank,

35
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,680
and this just tells it that it has

36
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,680
content so it can be displayed, and then

37
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:56,430
we're gonna set display to block. Save

38
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:56,430
this and refresh the page, and you won't

39
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,540
notice any difference because we haven't

40
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,540
applied styles to it, but when I drop

41
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:07,200
this down here you're now gonna see a

42
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:07,200
little before. It has no width, no height, or

43
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,410
it's actually full width because we set

44
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,410
display to block. If we didn't, it would

45
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,710
be 0 by 0. And if we set the content to

46
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,710
none, if I

47
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:17,940
disable that altogether, it's just gonna

48
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:17,940
go away. It just disappears. It needs to

49
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,140
have the content property set, you can

50
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,140
even put text in here if you want. We can

51
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:27,170
save it and refresh and there,

52
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:27,170
we've got content in it, you can see it.

53
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:31,770
But we don't want content in it, normally

54
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:31,770
you're not going to you, normally this is

55
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:39,000
going to be used to further style in the

56
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:39,000
first, beginning there. So let's say,

57
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
or it's gonna be further defining styles

58
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
for this element, it's just going to

59
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,980
create an additional element that you

60
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,980
can position differently. So let's say to

61
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:59,090
the left of that text I want to have a

62
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:59,090
box that's 5 pixels wide and 80

63
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:07,470
pixels high. So what I'm gonna do is I'm

64
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:07,470
going to set the width to, did I say 10

65
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:16,110
pixels? And then the height to 80 pixels,

66
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:16,110
save it and refresh, and again nothing

67
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:21,540
happens except you know it pushes

68
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:21,540
everything down, but you can't see

69
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:27,810
it itself yet. So here's where we're

70
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:27,810
gonna define the background. In this

71
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:33,450
instance, it's going to be black. We just

72
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:33,450
want to create a black rectangle to the

73
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:40,980
left. Well, that kind of screwed that up,

74
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:40,980
but that's where we use positioning. So

75
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:46,370
this is when absolute positioning should

76
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:46,370
be used. You're gonna set the position to

77
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:53,160
absolute, and then I'm gonna refresh, oh

78
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:53,160
the whole header is only 80 pixels high.

79
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:58,290
I thought it was 100. Let me change this

80
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:58,290
to take off 10 on both the top and

81
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:02,630
bottom, so the height of the before

82
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:02,630
pseudo-element now is gonna be 60 pixels,

83
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:08,100
there we go. We can actually go even

84
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:08,100
shorter. Let's go with 40 and see what that

85
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:15,410
looks like. And now with

86
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:15,410
positioning, with absolute positioning,

87
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:19,700
and here's where I'm gonna start to use

88
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:19,700
the console actually or the dev tools,

89
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:26,780
I'm going to select that, and I'm going

90
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:26,780
to start adding styles to it through

91
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:32,570
here. Writing CSS directly in the

92
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:32,570
developer tools is essentially the same

93
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:38,120
process as writing it within the actual

94
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:38,120
CSS file, except you don't have to keep

95
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,170
going back and forth if you're playing

96
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,170
around with something. So, what I'm gonna

97
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:49,610
do is I'm going to set margin-top to 20

98
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:49,610
pixels, and I'm gonna hover over it, and you

99
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:55,750
can see on the very top there, see the

100
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:55,750
orange space that it created, that's

101
00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:02,620
using margin to do what we want, and

102
00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:02,620
that's technically part of that element.

103
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:07,460
Although, it's unstyled. So what we're

104
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:07,460
gonna do instead is we're going to set

105
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:11,810
top to 20 pixels. As you can see, it didn't

106
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:11,810
move it, so it keeps it in the same

107
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:16,820
position as a 20 pixel margin did, except

108
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:16,820
now it does not become part of the

109
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:21,860
element. So, this is an absolute

110
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:21,860
positioning property, so it's left, right,

111
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:32,380
and bottom. So what I'm gonna do is I'm

112
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:32,380
going to set left to a 100 pixels,

113
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:40,640
and you'll see that it moved it over

114
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:40,640
here. Now if I remove the top rule here,

115
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:50,750
and the left, I'm gonna say a bottom is

116
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:50,750
equal to zero, and what this does is it

117
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:58,490
moves it to the bottom of its element.

118
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:58,490
I mean, I guess you can look at it like

119
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:02,990
this is a child element of header,

120
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:02,990
although it's not child element, it's

121
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:08,030
it's inside the header element, so this

122
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:08,030
is the container of it, but it's not a

123
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:14,930
child, I guess. It gets a little confusing

124
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:14,930
there. But, you can position it you know

125
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:19,850
left, and bottom, and top, and stuff, and

126
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:19,850
let's change the color so that we can

127
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:25,740
see the text underneath it, and you'll

128
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:25,740
see that it

129
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:33,780
defaults to, I mean we haven't applied any depth here. We've been working in two

130
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:38,520
dimensions so far, and that's the

131
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:38,520
horizontal and vertical, or the X and the

132
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,960
y-axis. But, we haven't even talked about

133
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,960
the z-axis and I think we should do that

134
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,000
in the next video, I don't think we

135
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,000
should do that right now, but that's, this

136
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,640
I guess it segues into that. So let's

137
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,640
stop here and in the next video let's

138
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,270
talk about depth.
