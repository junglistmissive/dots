1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,680
Alright, so, in this video what we're

2
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,680
going to be doing is learning about ways

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:10,769
that we can then use the variables that

4
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:10,769
we create to do certain things. So, I'm

5
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:16,170
going to create a variable here called

6
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:16,170
isPremiumUser. So, we start with the var

7
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:24,769
keyword and then we call it is premium

8
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:24,769
user, and this is going to be false. So,

9
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:30,800
here what we're going to do is we're

10
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:30,800
going to create an if statement that

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,329
basically determines you know if this is

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,329
true then do this, if it is false then do

13
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:42,809
that. So, what you do to create an if

14
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:42,809
statement you write the word if, and then

15
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:48,360
brackets, and you open and close them. And here is where you put your comparison

16
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:54,300
statement. So, just like in the previous

17
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:54,300
video we're going to say if(isPremiumUser

18
00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:07,740
== true) we're going to open up

19
00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:07,740
curly brackets and space it like that. So,

20
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:14,010
the syntax of this is the if keyword,

21
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:14,010
opening bracket, and then your comparison,

22
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:19,020
and then your closing bracket, and then

23
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:19,020
you open curly bracket, and you can close

24
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,259
the curly bracket, and all the code

25
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,259
that's going to run if that statement

26
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:28,470
equals true is going to be written in

27
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:28,470
here. So, for this instance what we're

28
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:42,299
going to do is just console.log("Thanks

29
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:42,299
for being a loyal customer!"). I'm going to

30
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:48,960
save it, and when I refresh this

31
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:48,960
nothing's printed out because I'm not a

32
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:55,229
premium user. If I change premium user to true and save it and refresh, then it

33
00:01:55,229 --> 00:02:03,000
says Thanks for being a loyal customer!

34
00:01:55,229 --> 00:02:03,000
Again, if I change it to false, it's not

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,489
going to do that. Now, if you're always

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,489
checking just what is true you don't

37
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:15,010
even have to put this part.

38
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:15,010
It's going to do a basic comparison right

39
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:23,080
off the bat to check if the variable is you

40
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:23,080
know if it exists and has a value, and if

41
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:27,430
it doesn't, and we can basically

42
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:27,430
shorthand this. If we're checking if

43
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:32,920
something is true, we can erase all that

44
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:32,920
and just type if and then the variable

45
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,660
that would either hold true or false. In

46
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,660
this case it holds false so it's not

47
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:46,230
going to do anything, but if I write true

48
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:46,230
here, save it, it's going to do this. Now,

49
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:54,700
this will work if a variable exists. So

50
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:54,700
if I create a string that says

51
00:02:54,700 --> 00:03:00,310
false inside of it, and refresh, it still

52
00:02:54,700 --> 00:03:00,310
prints that out because it's basically

53
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:08,250
saying if is premium user and it exists,

54
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:08,250
it has string, so it equals to true.

55
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:16,780
We're going to leave this false actually

56
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:16,780
and down here after we do the if

57
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:22,120
statement you can do an else statement,

58
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:22,120
and directly after the closing curly

59
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:27,040
bracket here just write the keyword else,

60
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:27,040
and then open up a new set of curly

61
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:36,100
brackets. And now this is going to be run

62
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:36,100
if is premium user is not true. So I'm

63
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:40,959
going to write this out the long way

64
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:40,959
just to simplify things here. So, if

65
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:47,320
(isPremiumUser == true) that's

66
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:47,320
going to do this bit of code, else it's

67
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:59,760
going to run this. So, console.log("You

68
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:59,760
should subscribe to our premium service.")

69
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:07,239
Save it and refresh, where it is false we

70
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:07,239
see you should subscribe to our premium

71
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:13,900
service because we've set these premium

72
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:13,900
user to false. So, what's happening is

73
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:22,530
saying if premium user then do whatever

74
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:22,530
is in here, so the compiler or the

75
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:28,880
interpreter, doesn't even parse

76
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:28,880
this code here if it is not true. It says

77
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:36,530
if this is true then do this, but if it's

78
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:36,530
not then run this. So, for instance, we

79
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:43,490
could put a variable in here that

80
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:43,490
doesn't exist, and it wouldn't freak out

81
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:49,759
or anything because it's not even

82
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:49,759
parsing this code. But, if we set this to

83
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,720
true it's gonna freak out

84
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,720
because it's going to say it's not

85
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:59,630
defined, we don't we haven't defined this.

86
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:59,630
So, that was just to show you guys

87
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:04,789
basically that it only reads I guess

88
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:04,789
what it needs to. I guess that's the

89
00:05:04,789 --> 00:05:11,479
easiest way to say it. Now, we're going to

90
00:05:04,789 --> 00:05:11,479
create another variable and we're going

91
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:19,580
to learn about else if, so if else if

92
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:19,580
else. It's going to make a lot more sense

93
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:26,330
once I write this out, so just bear with

94
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:26,330
me. var myAge is going to be equal to

95
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:35,210
28; So, what we can do is we're going to

96
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:35,210
create an if statement, and the

97
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:45,770
comparison here is going to be equal to,

98
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:45,770
or less than rather. So, if(myAge) is less

99
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:52,150
than 1 we're going to open up our curly

100
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:52,150
brackets, and we're going to

101
00:05:52,150 --> 00:06:02,419
console.log("You are a baby.") Then what

102
00:05:52,150 --> 00:06:02,419
we're going to do here instead of just

103
00:06:02,419 --> 00:06:06,620
writing else and then opening up curly

104
00:06:02,419 --> 00:06:06,620
braces which is kind of like a catch-all,

105
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:14,750
we're going to write else space if, and

106
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:14,750
we follow the same format. So, myAge is

107
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:23,110
less than 3, open up your curly brackets,

108
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:23,110
and we're going to print out console.log

109
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:28,449
("You are a toddler.")

110
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:32,620
And we're going to do this a few more

111
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:32,620
times, so get into practice of it. I'm

112
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:36,580
going to walk you through a few more

113
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:36,580
times just to make sure that we covered it,

114
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:43,720
and very well. So, after the closing curly

115
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:43,720
bracket of the previous step, you're

116
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:49,810
going to write else if, you're going to

117
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:49,810
open up your brackets, myAge is less

118
00:06:49,810 --> 00:07:13,590
than 10. We're going to say "You're a big

119
00:06:49,810 --> 00:07:13,590
kid." else if(myAge) is less than 19,

120
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:17,800
actually we're going to say less than or

121
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:17,800
equal to in this instance because 19 is

122
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:28,120
a teenager, and we're going to print out

123
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:28,120
"You are a teenager." And, we're going to do

124
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:35,340
two more, so else if(myAge) is less than

125
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:56,800
40, we're going to say "You are an adult."

126
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:56,800
else console.log("You must be old, you're

127
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:05,710
not in our records."). Save it, and then I'm

128
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:05,710
going to run this. It's going to print

129
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:18,430
out that I am an adult. So what happens

130
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:18,430
here, it might look that my age is

131
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:23,800
greater...so it's not less than 40 and it's

132
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:23,800
not you know else, what I'm going to do

133
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:32,020
is change my age to 4. I'm going to save it, refresh, and it says you're a big kid even though my

134
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:37,419
age is less than 10 which is the

135
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:37,419
condition it's capturing here. It's also

136
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:43,000
less than 19, but it's not printing this

137
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:43,000
out, and my age is also less than 40 and

138
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,860
it's not printing this out, and this is

139
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,860
because it stops at the first one where

140
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:54,610
the statement returns true. So, in this

141
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:54,610
instance it says is my age less than

142
00:08:54,610 --> 00:09:00,459
one? No, okay, move on. Is my age less than three? No, move on. Is my age less than ten?

143
00:09:00,459 --> 00:09:05,230
Yes! So, what's between these curly brackets?

144
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:09,910
And then it reads that and it prints it

145
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:09,910
out, and then it stops. It doesn't parse

146
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:15,550
any of this after that. So, you're

147
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:15,550
going to have to write these in a

148
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:19,930
certain way so that they make sense.

149
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:19,930
There are instances where if you write

150
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:23,709
it the wrong way the wrong thing is

151
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:23,709
going to happen, and I'm going to try and

152
00:09:23,709 --> 00:09:27,160
think of an example before I start the

153
00:09:23,709 --> 00:09:27,160
next video so that I can show you what

154
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:33,879
not to do, so that you're always going to

155
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:33,879
be writing these correctly. So that's an if

156
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:38,670
statement, and how to do a very basic one to check if something is true or false

157
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:48,339
which we're comparing an equal sign. So,

158
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:48,339
then we also compare an integer to

159
00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:53,800
hard coded integers. This is something

160
00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:53,800
that you don't want to do. You don't want

161
00:09:53,800 --> 00:10:01,509
to ever do it backwards. If one is

162
00:09:53,800 --> 00:10:01,509
greater than my age print out you're a

163
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:09,850
baby. Meaning that this would return true

164
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:09,850
if my age is anything less than one, but

165
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:15,579
this is written backwards. We

166
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:15,579
call this Yoda code because in Star Wars

167
00:10:15,579 --> 00:10:22,110
Yoda talks backwards. So, you never want

168
00:10:15,579 --> 00:10:22,110
to write it like this, you always want to...

169
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:31,209
you're going to compare something to

170
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:31,209
something. So the thing that we're

171
00:10:31,209 --> 00:10:37,779
comparing is my age that always goes on

172
00:10:31,209 --> 00:10:37,779
the left. So, yeah, that's if statements

173
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:43,629
and else if and else, we're going to be

174
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:43,629
learning more about these types of loops,

175
00:10:43,629 --> 00:10:49,149
or conditional statements we call them,

176
00:10:43,629 --> 00:10:49,149
or rather just bigger chunks of code,

177
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,910
that's a better way to put it. We're

178
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,910
going to be covering that more in the

179
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:54,420
next video.
