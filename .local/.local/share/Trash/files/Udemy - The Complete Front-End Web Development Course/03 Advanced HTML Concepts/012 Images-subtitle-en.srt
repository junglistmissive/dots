1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,510
Alright guys. So what we're going to be

2
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,510
learning about in this video is just how

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:08,580
to put images into a webpage, and it's

4
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:08,580
important to note that images or image

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,400
tags are block level, which means they're

6
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,400
going to appear full width within the page.

7
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:18,480
So, for our news article here I've

8
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:18,480
downloaded some images. I've downloaded a

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:25,140
dog, chocolate, and HTML 5 from Google, and these are going to be corresponding to

10
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,590
each article, as you can see here. So, each

11
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,590
article is going to have it's own image.

12
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:36,410
So what we're going to do is jump up to

13
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:36,410
the top one here, and the image should be

14
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:43,410
above the title. Within the article

15
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:43,410
we're going to go ahead and type img. Now

16
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:50,640
this is self closing. That's all you need

17
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:50,640
to do to create an image element, but as

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,910
you'll see there's no image inside of it

19
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,910
and that's because there's an essential

20
00:00:53,910 --> 00:01:01,050
property here, or attribute of the

21
00:00:53,910 --> 00:01:01,050
element, which is src. And this basically

22
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:05,580
is an abbreviation for the word source.

23
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:05,580
So we need the source of the image that

24
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:10,439
we want to show here, and that is a file

25
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:10,439
path. Now if it's within the same

26
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:13,470
directory you don't have to worry about

27
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:13,470
anything just type the name of

28
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:21,720
the file. So in this case it's dog.jpg, save it refresh, and there we go.

29
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:28,140
There's the picture of our dog. Let's go

30
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:28,140
ahead and create one for the second

31
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:34,470
article which is about chocolate in

32
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:34,470
outer space. So the source for this one

33
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:40,350
is going to be chocolate.jpg, but what

34
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:40,350
you can do is, if you want, if it's in the

35
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:45,119
same directory, and this is going to be

36
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:45,119
relevant sometimes, if it's in the same

37
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:50,130
directory at the same path you can use

38
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:50,130
just the title. And once we get into

39
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:54,270
rewriting and stuff for URLs, which might

40
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:54,270
not even be in this course, you're going

41
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:57,090
to have to reference the current

42
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:57,090
directory that this page is in, so that's

43
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:08,670
./ So, it's chocolate.jpg, and then we close it. As you can see,

44
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:14,160
new study confirms chocolate is in space,

45
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:14,160
Mars bar, which is fitting. And then

46
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:26,130
finally we have the html5 article, and so

47
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:26,130
the source in this one...we can see

48
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:32,390
the source to our project, so we're going

49
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:32,390
to put an absolute source here. So,

50
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:45,660
C:\Users\nickg\Projects\web-course

51
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:45,660
and then the file name which is

52
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:54,030
html5.png, and then self close that. And we see here this is actually pretty big, so

53
00:02:54,030 --> 00:03:00,840
what I need to do is I need to set the

54
00:02:54,030 --> 00:03:00,840
width of this to a 100%, or

55
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,549
any pixel size we could also do. But by

56
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,549
setting it to a hundred percent it's just

57
00:03:05,549 --> 00:03:09,720
going to make it only be as wide as the

58
00:03:05,549 --> 00:03:09,720
page, but then it's also going to scale

59
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,769
it proportionally so that it won't be

60
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,769
stretched or anything, it will then

61
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:18,750
become as tall as it needs to be to fit

62
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:18,750
the width that we've specified. And so

63
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:22,590
that is the image tag and how to add it

64
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:22,590
to your web page.

65
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:27,329
These are block elements but you can do

66
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:27,329
crafty things like making them up here

67
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:32,420
inline, and we're going to be getting

68
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:32,420
into that with CSS.
