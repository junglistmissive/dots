1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,210
Alright guys. So, we've got a mostly

2
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,210
working form here with very basic

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:10,519
functionality. What we're going to be

4
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:10,519
doing is adding in a way for the user to

5
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:17,179
select a size. So under the address here,

6
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:25,230
let me move these lines here so I can

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:25,230
get both of those line breaks above

8
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:30,630
where I'm going to create the size, I'm going to

9
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:30,630
create an h4 element as a title so we

10
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:39,149
can know what this refers to. It's going

11
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:39,149
to be Size. So we open it, type stuff,

12
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:47,489
close it, and now we're going to create a

13
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:47,489
select attribute or element. And what

14
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:56,180
this is it's multiple choice in a

15
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:56,180
drop-down that people can select one of.

16
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:03,570
So it's kind of like a radio element

17
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:03,570
except it displays in a drop-down. You

18
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:09,150
can also select multiple in a select box,

19
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:09,150
and that's not really pertinent to what

20
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:14,159
we're doing here. So just learning the

21
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:14,159
select box that's what it does. So we're

22
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:20,220
going to give it a name and the name is

23
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:20,220
going to be size, and that's all we need

24
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:26,369
to do. So let's go ahead and close this

25
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:26,369
select element. I'm going to save it and

26
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:30,570
refresh here, and you'll see that it

27
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:30,570
drops down but there's nothing in it yet

28
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:34,710
because we haven't put anything in it. So

29
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:34,710
that's what we're going to be learning

30
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:41,909
now. Within a select element which lets

31
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:41,909
you select items from a drop-down we

32
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:46,070
need to have options, and so the next

33
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:46,070
element we're going to learn is very

34
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:52,380
appropriately named option. And each

35
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:52,380
option is going to have a property of

36
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,969
value and this is going to be what the

37
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,969
option is. So we're going to start off

38
00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:09,950
with 12-inch, and let's put the cost

39
00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:09,950
there too. Let's say

40
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:18,550
$13.99...I'm not sure if that's expensive

41
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:18,550
or not, but it's good pizza. So, the next

42
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:26,380
one is going to be 16 inches, and just so

43
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:26,380
you guys can see better the format of it

44
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:31,270
you open it, and you never

45
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:31,270
put an attribute in the closing tag,

46
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:35,530
I guess that's important to know, you

47
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:35,530
only ever put attributes within the

48
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:41,769
opening tag itself. So we're going to say

49
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:41,769
16 inch and we're going to say that is

50
00:02:41,769 --> 00:02:51,549
going to be $16.99. On the next line, and we don't need to add line breaks or

51
00:02:51,549 --> 00:02:56,560
anything it's all automatic here within

52
00:02:51,549 --> 00:02:56,560
the select list, we're going to create

53
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:05,950
another one with a value of 18, and we're

54
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:05,950
going to type out what's going to appear

55
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:16,510
as the option, and this is going to be

56
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:16,510
$19.99. And then just in case anybody's

57
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:22,570
really hungry, we need to add a very

58
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:22,570
large option and this is going to be 72

59
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:35,140
inches, and the price for that is going

60
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:35,140
to be $149.99. Alright, so, with our

61
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:42,090
select box created and four options

62
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:42,090
within it, I'm going to save this and

63
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:50,410
refresh, and there we go.

64
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:50,410
So we've got our select box there. It's

65
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:54,430
going to let people choose a size. So

66
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:54,430
right now this is basically feature

67
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:58,840
complete as what it's intended to do on

68
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:58,840
the front end. We give the user the

69
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,950
option of delivery or pickup. If they

70
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,950
choose delivery they need to add in

71
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:08,079
their address, maybe their phone number

72
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:08,079
as well. We let them choose a size of a

73
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:13,150
pizza, and then also ingredients. These

74
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:13,150
are all the important things about

75
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:17,919
ordering a pizza. These are the things

76
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:17,919
you need to be able to do. So what we're

77
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,670
going to do now, we're ready for it, we

78
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,670
just need to let them

79
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:32,770
send it to us. So we're going to create a

80
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:32,770
button with a type submit, and it's

81
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:39,160
going to say Place Order, and we're going

82
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:39,160
to close that button. I'm going to save

83
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:44,740
it here, and then refresh, I need to add a

84
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:44,740
line break above that. It doesn't look quite

85
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:50,340
right, I'm going to add two of them actually.

86
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:58,210
There we go. So now what we're able to do

87
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:58,210
is we're able to select a few different

88
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:06,010
ones, and then hit place order. As you can

89
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:06,010
see, I've made this a get method up in

90
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:11,050
the form here, the method is equal to get,

91
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:11,050
and so what it does is it carries across

92
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:19,150
all these values as you know in the in

93
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:19,150
the URL. So this is how they're going to

94
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:25,840
be accessed within PHP. If you wanted to

95
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:25,840
automate this a bit, I mean this is

96
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,560
why you would use get. If you want to

97
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,560
send someone directly to a page and send

98
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,850
parameters to that page as well, you're

99
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,850
going to use this. So if I sent you a

100
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:41,950
link like this it would automatically order

101
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:41,950
you a pizza at my address. So, that's how

102
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:51,000
the get method works. And post, just so you

103
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:51,000
guys can see, go back here and refresh.

104
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:58,750
I'm going to place our order again, I'm going

105
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:58,750
to hit place order, and it sends it to

106
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:03,220
the place order script without the URL.

107
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:03,220
So it's all done behind the scenes, and

108
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:07,860
that's why you would use the post method

109
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:07,860
for sensitive data like passwords, or

110
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:16,120
address, stuff like that. So that is our

111
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:16,120
form and basically that's complete,

112
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:21,420
except for one final touch and we're

113
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:21,420
going to add that in the next video.
