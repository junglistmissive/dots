1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,940
Alright guys. I got some good news, and I

2
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,940
got some bad news. So the good news is

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:09,750
we're ready to go ahead with the next

4
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:09,750
step and make this look a little better.

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:17,010
The bad news is that I was not able to

6
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:17,010
find any icon fonts that have the

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:23,670
icons that we need. Now the other good

8
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:23,670
news is we can always use images. So, I'm

9
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,939
going to go ahead and search here on

10
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,939
Google, and you guys can do the same. We

11
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:36,739
need three or five icons. We need an icon

12
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:36,739
of a gun, crosshairs, a helmet, something

13
00:00:36,739 --> 00:00:42,840
charge, maybe electricity, and then a

14
00:00:36,739 --> 00:00:42,840
radiation symbol. So I'm going to precede

15
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:52,590
each one of these searches with the word

16
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:52,590
icon gun, and I'm just gonna grab this

17
00:00:52,590 --> 00:01:07,189
one right here. I didn't mean to inspect

18
00:00:52,590 --> 00:01:07,189
that. Save image. It's actually under

19
00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:17,659
webstorm projects. There we go. Crosshairs...

20
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:36,010
and this looks about right. So let's save

21
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:36,010
this as well. A helmet...

22
00:01:43,770 --> 00:02:08,119
this isn't very helpful. Sorry, just

23
00:01:43,770 --> 00:02:08,119
sneezed there. None of these really look

24
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:16,700
accurate as to what the image showed, or

25
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:16,700
the pip-boy, rather. I don't think it's

26
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:22,340
really necessary, I guess. Let's go ahead

27
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:22,340
and grab this one.

28
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:38,040
That's SVG which should be fine. Then we need

29
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:38,040
energy, so icon charge. And something

30
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:43,260
like this right here, but that has a

31
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:43,260
weird kind of overlay on it. I guess they

32
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:48,260
don't want people taking it, so let's not.

33
00:02:52,459 --> 00:03:10,560
Search for energy...that will do. Save this.

34
00:02:52,459 --> 00:03:10,560
And then the last one is a radiation, or

35
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:17,879
nuclear, rather. But they should both

36
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:17,879
turn up the same thing. One of them

37
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:21,120
should look something like this. But, that's

38
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:21,120
not a PNG image, so we can't really use

39
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,379
that. Let's go ahead and look at this one.

40
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,379
No, we need a transparent background.

41
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:30,810
That's one of the one of the things we

42
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:30,810
do absolutely need. If we can't find one

43
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:35,760
we can always use one that looks

44
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:35,760
slightly different, like this. So, save

45
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:42,329
that image. There we go. Now we've got all

46
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:42,329
our images so now we need to add them in

47
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:50,220
here. This of course is the gun. So let me

48
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:50,220
go ahead in here and label them, maybe I

49
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:59,750
should have. That one, that one, there we

50
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:59,750
go.

51
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:19,139
So in here it was right here, and this is

52
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:19,139
going to be 2459-200.png

53
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:26,539
with a class of image-responsive.

54
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:36,330
Save it and refresh, let's see what we've

55
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:36,330
got here. Set the width of that to a

56
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:45,590
hundred percent, and then we're gonna

57
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:45,590
have to apply filters on it. So filter,

58
00:04:46,010 --> 00:05:00,020
grayscale is one, invert two, brightness two,

59
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:17,410
let's remove the invert. Just trust on

60
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:17,410
the brightness adding up. Contrast zero,

61
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:35,030
that looks a bit better, and then sepia. And then hue

62
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:35,030
rotate is gonna be 55 degrees, and then

63
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:44,930
saturate it's gonna be 20. There we go.

64
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:44,930
Let's have a look at the pip-boy...it looks

65
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:50,419
just about right. I think that's

66
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:50,419
as good as I can get it, anyway. So, let's

67
00:05:50,419 --> 00:06:05,510
go ahead and style these up. So in stat-numbers, image, you need these. Save and

68
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:12,889
refresh, and there we go. Now I can add

69
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:12,889
the crosshairs one here, so it's right

70
00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:27,979
here. So image, and the crosshairs one was this one I believe, it was. So 27502-200.png

71
00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:35,360
I don't think I need to add a class

72
00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:35,360
there. Save, refresh, and this one needs to

73
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:43,030
go a bit bigger. So, width, actually...

74
00:06:49,970 --> 00:07:02,840
we need to increase that size quite

75
00:06:49,970 --> 00:07:02,840
a bit. Not that much.

76
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:14,790
Then we need to margin-left is going

77
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:14,790
to be -5 pixels. There we go. I'm

78
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:24,330
going to set this to sm-image so that we

79
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:24,330
can style that on its own. Save.

80
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:34,490
Stat-numbers, img.sm-image, I think that's

81
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:34,490
what I called it.

82
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:42,500
Alright. Save it and refresh, there we go.

83
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:56,000
Now we need that helmet which I believe

84
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:56,000
was the SVG image. Yes, it was.

85
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:06,979
Alright, so let's close

86
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:06,979
this. This right here.

87
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:26,030
I'm totally gonna rename this, it's gonna

88
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:26,030
make a lot easier, and class image-

89
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:41,240
responsive. Save and refresh, there we go. Not quite big enough though. Oh, there's

90
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:53,390
padding around it, that's why. So I'm

91
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:53,390
gonna set this one to 140

92
00:08:53,390 --> 00:09:02,860
pixels, then we're gonna set margin

93
00:08:53,390 --> 00:09:02,860
left to negative 20 pixels, and set this to zero.

94
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:06,529
That's totally a negative five, there we

95
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:06,529
go.

96
00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:13,760
And padding-top is gonna be five pixels

97
00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:13,760
as well. So this is gonna be specific to

98
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:25,060
the helmet icon, so we need to add a

99
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:25,060
class here. Save this, jump back over here...

100
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:35,120
save it and refresh. Awesome, we have two

101
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:35,120
more icons to do, and then we need to fix

102
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:46,640
up the numbers, and also the general

103
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:46,640
position of this. So the energy should be

104
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,380
that right there, and it's going to be kind of the same

105
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,380
story. I think we're gonna need to custom

106
00:09:51,380 --> 00:10:07,750
style that. Let's jump down create image

107
00:09:51,380 --> 00:10:07,750
source icons_energy_managers.png, and

108
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:13,490
then close that off. Save it and refresh.

109
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:13,490
We will need to style that, but for right

110
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:19,279
now let's leave it as is and go ahead

111
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:19,279
and add the irradiation icon as well. So

112
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:32,300
I'm just going to drop down in here.

113
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:32,300
Image source equals radiation icon, and I

114
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:36,579
love autocomplete specifically for that.

115
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:49,069
Save and refresh, and there we've got all

116
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:49,069
our icons in. But now, this whole thing is

117
00:10:49,069 --> 00:10:52,970
looking a bit off-kilter.

118
00:10:49,069 --> 00:10:52,970
What would happen if I removed this one

119
00:10:52,970 --> 00:11:00,910
altogether.

120
00:10:52,970 --> 00:11:00,910
That's a little too...let's set the first one...

121
00:11:00,939 --> 00:11:13,850
spacing. Let's do that. Instead of having

122
00:11:00,939 --> 00:11:13,850
a col-2 at the very

123
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:24,290
beginning, I'm gonna have a spacer-numbers. Let's save it, and let's give

124
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:40,639
that an absolute width here. A little more...that looks about right. That looks more

125
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:45,649
right. So let's say 50 pixels. So spaceer-numbers, that's a really bad name to give

126
00:11:45,649 --> 00:11:54,560
that, but it does what we need it to do,

127
00:11:45,649 --> 00:11:54,560
spacer-numbers be this. And then we need

128
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,569
to move this row up a bit, if we can, and

129
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,569
we should be able to. I'm gonna say

130
00:11:59,569 --> 00:12:08,720
margin-top equals negative 50 pixels.

131
00:11:59,569 --> 00:12:08,720
That looks about right. So this is going

132
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:23,630
to be stat numbers. There we go. This is

133
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:23,630
the main page of the pip-boy. It does

134
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:28,040
have a name down there as well which we

135
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:28,040
haven't added. And a few things are off,

136
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,009
like this progress bar should be a bit

137
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,009
bigger, and this is something you guys

138
00:12:31,009 --> 00:12:35,149
can play around with. In the next video I

139
00:12:31,009 --> 00:12:35,149
think we're just gonna finish up this

140
00:12:35,149 --> 00:12:42,259
part just by maybe making an inventory

141
00:12:35,149 --> 00:12:42,259
page, and most of the concepts on all the

142
00:12:42,259 --> 00:12:46,279
other pages will inherit from the

143
00:12:42,259 --> 00:12:46,279
inventory, or data page. So I think just

144
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:50,809
the inventory one will be fine. Thank you

145
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:50,809
guys for watching, and I'll see you guys

146
00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:53,319
in the next video.
