1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,460
So you guys remember in one of the first

2
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,460
videos that we did in the HTML section I

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:11,160
I explained how the main difference

4
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:11,160
between a div element and a span element.

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:19,310
They are both generic, they're just used to

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:19,310
apply specific rules, and they're not

7
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:25,740
special elements like a header, you know.

8
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:25,740
And even the header doesn't apply a lot

9
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,580
of rules just to the header because it's

10
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,580
a header, but for instance in a element

11
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:38,370
does. It applies you know a text color,

12
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:38,370
and an underline, etc. And so a div, and a

13
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:43,290
span, and a header, and a main, and a section,

14
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:43,290
they're all generic. They generally have

15
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:48,960
the same rules applied by default with

16
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:48,960
the exception sometimes of block level

17
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:55,620
and inline display. So what we can do, we

18
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:55,620
can change block level elements to

19
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:01,230
inline. And how we do that,

20
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:01,230
so the h1 element is a block level, if I

21
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:06,390
hover over it here you're going to see

22
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:06,390
its full width, and if I change the

23
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:13,890
height, it actually does it, it changes

24
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:13,890
the height. So that's a very good

25
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:20,939
way of you know determining if an

26
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:20,939
item is block or inline. If it's block

27
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:25,500
it's going to be full width and you can

28
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:25,500
define the height, if it's inline you

29
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,549
cannot define the height. So what I'm

30
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,549
going to do is I'm going to change the

31
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:36,299
h1 element here to be inline instead of

32
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:36,299
block, and how we're going to do that in

33
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:43,259
my style sheet I'm going to target it,

34
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:43,259
open up the rule curly braces here, and

35
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:48,180
there's a property that you can set for

36
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:48,180
every single element. The property name

37
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:56,009
is display. And as you can see by this

38
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:56,009
pop-up, these are valid values for this

39
00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:04,229
display attribute. So, by default the h1

40
00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:04,229
is a block, but we can change it to inline. So

41
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:09,149
let's go ahead and change that, save it

42
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:09,149
and refresh, and what you're going to see

43
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:19,760
is that here it is not full width. If I change

44
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:19,760
the height it does not change it,

45
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:30,690
because it is now inline. Now there is

46
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:30,690
also a little, there's like a middle

47
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:35,880
way here, so we can change it to inline

48
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:35,880
block. Save and refresh, what you're going

49
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:40,200
to see is by default it is only as wide

50
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:40,200
as it has to be, but now you can add

51
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:48,930
height to it, as such. So inline blocks are

52
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:48,930
only as wide as they have to be but they

53
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:53,520
can use a height, block elements are full

54
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:53,520
width and can use height, and inline

55
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:58,320
elements are just like span elements, like

56
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:58,320
text here, they're just as high as

57
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:05,910
they have to be. So what I'm going to do

58
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:05,910
is I'm going to change this now, which is

59
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:11,550
the h3 element, I'm going to change that to

60
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:11,550
inline block as well. And how we're going

61
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:17,010
to do that is I'm going to put a comma

62
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:17,010
here and put h3. Now in CSS this means

63
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:24,180
any element that is either, that is

64
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:24,180
either an h1 or an h3 element apply this

65
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,690
rule to it, so it doesn't have to be both,

66
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,690
it needs to be either/or. So I'm going to

67
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:33,290
hit save and refresh, and we're going to

68
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:33,290
see that now they're on the same line.

69
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:39,570
Now something to note with this is that

70
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:39,570
the line height is going to become

71
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:44,970
important, because if the

72
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:44,970
line height is different, so for instance

73
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:49,050
if the text sizes are different, it's

74
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:49,050
going to stretch the entire line and

75
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:55,350
it's going to change where the smallest

76
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:55,350
element is placed. So, what we can do

77
00:03:55,350 --> 00:04:00,870
there is we can add some margin, or we

78
00:03:55,350 --> 00:04:00,870
can change the line height, or we can

79
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:08,220
even just change the height itself. So

80
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:08,220
let's hard limit this to height is 20

81
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:16,820
pixels, save it and refresh, and that

82
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:16,820
still didn't do it. So let's set margin

83
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:26,940
to zero pixels, save, refresh, now you'll

84
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:26,940
see that still they're not the correct

85
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:33,160
spacing. So I'm going to set line height now, and this applies to text,

86
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:39,460
it's for how high the line can be itself.

87
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:39,460
So we're going to set this to 20 pixels.

88
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:45,400
Save it,

89
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:45,400
refresh, and that still didn't really

90
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:51,460
align it, and it's because the baseline

91
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:51,460
here. Now how we would do this, if we

92
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:55,090
wanted to, and this is something that

93
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:55,090
I did previously but I didn't really

94
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:58,930
explain it that well because it

95
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:58,930
wasn't necessary at the time, we're going

96
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:08,949
to make this float. Erase all this, put it

97
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:08,949
back to normal, and then in just the h1

98
00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:15,099
element I'm going to write float, and as

99
00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:15,099
you can see these values for it, and I'm

100
00:05:15,099 --> 00:05:21,070
going to say left. What this means when i

101
00:05:15,099 --> 00:05:21,070
refresh is it's going to pull this to

102
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,520
the left of all the content, and any

103
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,520
content that can fit to the right of it

104
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:32,020
will. Now as you notice there are some

105
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:32,020
interesting things that will happen with

106
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:37,360
this. This, the background, is still all

107
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:37,360
the way over there because this element

108
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:43,599
technically exists there, but the content

109
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:43,599
of it will only begin whenever the right

110
00:05:43,599 --> 00:05:55,810
side of this ends. So, I'm going to set

111
00:05:43,599 --> 00:05:55,810
margin-left equal to 200 pixels. It needs to

112
00:05:55,810 --> 00:06:10,330
be a bit more, 260. There we go. And then

113
00:05:55,810 --> 00:06:10,330
padding off margin-top, 50 pixels. Now as

114
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:15,849
you'll see what happened there is the

115
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:15,849
margin of this has caused the floating

116
00:06:15,849 --> 00:06:21,070
left element to go down as well. So with

117
00:06:15,849 --> 00:06:21,070
the margin, as I explained in the

118
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:26,110
previous videos the orange there is the

119
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:26,110
margin, so you can set an overall margin

120
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:33,310
if we wanted all sides to be the same, we

121
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:33,310
would set margin just to one value, let's

122
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:38,740
say 10 pixels, and this would give it 10

123
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:38,740
pixels outside the element on all sides.

124
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:42,610
But,

125
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:42,610
you can also add margin, you can override

126
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:47,380
say one rule if you want, let's say margin-top,

127
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:47,380
let's set that twenty pixels. What will

128
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:51,190
happen now is the left bottom and right

129
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:51,190
sides will have a margin of ten pixels,

130
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:56,979
and the top will have a margin of 20

131
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:56,979
pixels, and again this means that the

132
00:06:56,979 --> 00:07:05,410
element will begin within the confines

133
00:06:56,979 --> 00:07:05,410
of that margin. So see the background of

134
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:11,860
that element, the white background

135
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:11,860
doesn't begin, it only fills the inside

136
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:18,190
space, the margin is considered outside

137
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:18,190
space. So this is good for spacing

138
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:23,949
elements away from each other, but if you

139
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:23,949
wanted to add more space between the

140
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:27,880
element and the content within the

141
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:27,880
element, what you're going to do is use

142
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:36,070
padding. I'm going to set this really big so

143
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:36,070
you guys can see, 50 pixels, there we

144
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:42,069
go. What happens now, as you can see with

145
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:42,069
the green, is that the padding exists

146
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:49,360
within the element, while the margin

147
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:49,360
exists outside of the element, and there

148
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,720
are times when you want to use either/or

149
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,720
and it might not be as obvious when

150
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,020
you're first looking at it, but there are

151
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,020
times when you might want to use padding

152
00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:01,509
instead of margin, and we will definitely

153
00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:01,509
get an opportunity to see that because

154
00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:04,360
we're actually

155
00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:04,360
going to be building a web site, and

156
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:09,520
padding and margin are two very, very

157
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:09,520
important parts of a website to properly

158
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,479
place elements.
