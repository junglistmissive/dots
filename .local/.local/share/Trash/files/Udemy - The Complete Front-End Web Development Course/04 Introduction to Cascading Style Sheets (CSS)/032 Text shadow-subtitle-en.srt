1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,970
Alright, welcome back guys. We are not

2
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,970
going to be talking about pseudo states

3
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:06,060
in this video, we're going to be doing

4
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:06,060
that in the next video, and the reason is

5
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:12,240
is because we're going to start, well

6
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:12,240
we're going to be talking about text

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,340
shadow, and that's the final text

8
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,340
property that I think we need

9
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:22,830
to focus on here.

10
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:22,830
So, let's go ahead and we're going to be

11
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:29,699
applying this rule to the body element,

12
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:29,699
and all inherited elements. So any child

13
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:34,710
element of the body is going to get a

14
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:34,710
text shadow as well. And as you can guess,

15
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:42,390
it's a two word property so it's

16
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:42,390
separated by a dash, text-shadow, and now

17
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:48,780
this is going to take a possible

18
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:48,780
four values that you pass in. The first

19
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:56,239
is the direction vertically, so let's say

20
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:56,239
2 pixels. The second is going to be the

21
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:03,870
distance from the text horizontally. The

22
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:03,870
third one is going to be a color. I'll save it

23
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:09,840
and refresh, sorry the first property

24
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:09,840
is left and right. I think I said that

25
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:16,049
one was up and down. So what we're going to be doing here, is that looks alright,

26
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:23,960
but the text shadow is not spread at all.

27
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:23,960
It's exactly the same weight and

28
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,689
thickness. So what we're going to do is

29
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,689
add a spread here, and we're going to set

30
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:33,540
that to 5 pixels as well, and it's going

31
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:33,540
to blur the text shadow and make it

32
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:41,460
actually look like a shadow. That's good.

33
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:41,460
We can set the previous two properties,

34
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,570
the first two, with a negative sign

35
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,570
that's going to move it in the opposite

36
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:52,909
direction. So, this one just defines the

37
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:52,909
gravity of the direction I guess, or the

38
00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:58,860
anti-gravity, because it's the opposite.

39
00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:58,860
Two pixels set as the first property

40
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:05,700
means two pixels to the right of the text,

41
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:05,700
negative five pixels means negative five

42
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:11,190
pixels down, right, so that would

43
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:11,190
obviously be five pixels up. That's

44
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:15,120
what's happened here.

45
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:15,120
I'm going to set these a little more

46
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:22,890
conservatively to both two pixels, and

47
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:22,890
refresh, that looks a little better. And

48
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:29,600
the spread I'm going to set that to 10

49
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:29,600
pixels just to spread it out a bit more.

50
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,900
Actually, no, what I'm going to do is

51
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,900
set these to one pixel, one pixel, and

52
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,900
then spread is going to be two pixels.

53
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,900
We're going to go really conservative

54
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:47,610
with this. And what you'll notice is the

55
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:47,610
the higher you set the spread, the

56
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:54,990
more it actually spreads it and lightens

57
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:54,990
it. You'll see here it's a light gray, but

58
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:59,370
if we only use a two pixel spread it's

59
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:59,370
going to be all condensed into those two

60
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:03,030
pixels. So what we're going to do is

61
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:03,030
we're going to set the color using

62
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:08,910
RGBA, and that way we can add alpha to it as well. And the reason we would do this

63
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:17,130
is because, we could totally set this to

64
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:17,130
a light gray color. So, I mean, that's too

65
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:24,709
light. Let's set it to ddd...it's a little bit

66
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:24,709
too light, let's set it to aaa,

67
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:29,570
there we go. We can kind of see that now.

68
00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:35,130
What's going to happen, this works on a

69
00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:35,130
white background because the text shadow

70
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:39,840
is between the text color and the

71
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:39,840
background. It looks like the background

72
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:46,140
is just darkened. Actually, I'm going to

73
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:46,140
set this quite low so we can get it a

74
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:54,709
little better. But what happens, let's say

75
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:54,709
I set the articles with a background of

76
00:03:54,709 --> 00:04:02,250
red, what happens is the text shadow doesn't

77
00:03:54,709 --> 00:04:02,250
account for that really, and it's still

78
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:12,390
dark. If I set this down to 000 you're

79
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:12,390
going to see that. Now setting the

80
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:18,320
property that way would work over here,

81
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:18,320
and it's really noticeable when we just

82
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:25,530
remove the spread all together. It's

83
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:25,530
still black rather than just

84
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:29,569
a darkened version. I mean, it's hard to see what I mean,

85
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:36,080
but you guys will encounter instances

86
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:36,080
where you see this. So what I'm going to do

87
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,830
is we're going to set this

88
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,830
with an RGBA color, I'm going to set it

89
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:46,430
to 0, 0, 0, and .3,

90
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:46,430
save it and refresh, and there is our

91
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:53,990
text shadow. It looks a bit better on all

92
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:53,990
different colored backgrounds. Let me get

93
00:04:53,990 --> 00:05:03,050
that out of there. And along the same

94
00:04:53,990 --> 00:05:03,050
lines are box shadows. So a box shadow is

95
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:08,150
kind of used in the same way to a text

96
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:08,150
shadow, but it's intended for elements

97
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:13,250
that aren't text, I guess. Not the internal

98
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:13,250
content, but rather the external content

99
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,400
or the element itself. So we're going to

100
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,400
set that on the articles, and we're going

101
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:23,090
to set box a shadow, and using the same

102
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:23,090
properties. The only difference is this

103
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:30,289
one can actually use, it can have a

104
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:30,289
maximum of five values instead of just

105
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:39,139
four. So, the first one is going to be the

106
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:39,139
left-right direction so let's say five

107
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:47,810
pixels, five pixels vertically, five pixel

108
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:47,810
spread, and then we're going to set the

109
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:59,270
color again to RGBA. Set that to

110
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:59,270
0, 0, 0, .6, and then we're going to end that line

111
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:04,089
with a semicolon,

112
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:04,089
and refresh, and there's our text shadow,

113
00:06:04,089 --> 00:06:10,909
or there's our box shadow, rather. Now

114
00:06:04,089 --> 00:06:10,909
what you can do is you can set this

115
00:06:10,909 --> 00:06:18,770
value very low, and it's going to make it

116
00:06:10,909 --> 00:06:18,770
less spread, obviously. Or you can set it

117
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:25,879
very high, that's not very high but

118
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:25,879
that's a bit higher, and you can make it

119
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:32,180
a bigger, softer shadow. I guess soft is

120
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:32,180
the term. But, what if you want the

121
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:35,719
spread that high and you want it still

122
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:35,719
very dense? What you can do is set a

123
00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:41,200
fourth property which is also in pixels,

124
00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:41,200
and this changes

125
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:49,850
the density of the shadow. So if we now set this to two pixels, third property rather

126
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:58,610
two pixels, this controls how far the

127
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:58,610
shadow outreach is, while this is I

128
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:04,640
guess the softness. So let's set that back to

129
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:04,640
20, this back to set it to negative one,

130
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:11,750
let's refresh, and there we've got box

131
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:11,750
shadows that look alright. Now, this is

132
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:20,030
when the RGBA color for this is

133
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:20,030
going to make sense, I'm going to set

134
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:27,860
this to .2, and we've got a very,

135
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:27,860
very light hint of shadow there. Let me

136
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:33,740
increase that to .3 actually, that's a

137
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:33,740
little bit better. There you go.

138
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:37,220
Now in the next video we're talking about

139
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:37,220
pseudo states, this is going to become

140
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:41,330
really relevant because we're going to

141
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:41,330
be mixing pseudo states with these box

142
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:43,780
shadows.
