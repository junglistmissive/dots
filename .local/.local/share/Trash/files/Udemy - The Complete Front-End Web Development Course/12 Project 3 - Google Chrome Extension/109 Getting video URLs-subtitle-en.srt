1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,160
All right guys.

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:06,330
So what we need to do at this point is we actually need to be able to get the you are out of the video.

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:12,300
Now this is where things are going to get a little complicated and unreliable as I'm not sure how often

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:18,270
YouTube is going to change this but for right now their systems are set up in a way that we can grab

5
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:26,160
the video you are Elle's right from one symbol variable that they already have set and it's why the

6
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:40,910
player dot config dot org because you are all underscore in coded underscore f m t underscore stream

7
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:43,120
the underscore Now

8
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,910
the guys type that.

9
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:54,040
I know that's really long but what that does is that gives us a comma separated list of the different

10
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:59,950
types of you are elves so different video formats and quality and stuff.

11
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:05,260
So what I'm going to do is we're actually going to split that when we run it so we can get an array

12
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,610
of each of you or else.

13
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:13,600
So I'm just going to click up on my keyboard get the last command back in the input field and then I'm

14
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:23,840
going to put split comma and here I've got these your elves here that read.

15
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:30,010
So in the file right here what we're going to do is we're going to basically just do that.

16
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:37,310
So var video you are owls is going to be equal to y t layer.

17
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,090
And it was y t player

18
00:01:42,010 --> 00:02:00,490
config dot words dot you r l encoded f m t stream map and we're going to split it at the comma.

19
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,550
And this is going to be the video u r l.

20
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:07,250
It's going to return that object and then we're going to have to modify it further.
