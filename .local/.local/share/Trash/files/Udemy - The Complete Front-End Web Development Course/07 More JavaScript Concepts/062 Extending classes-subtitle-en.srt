1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,240
Alright, guys. So, I hope you've been

2
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,240
playing around with classes a little bit

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:09,349
and figured you know some stuff out

4
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:09,349
about it that maybe I haven't mentioned.

5
00:00:09,349 --> 00:00:14,070
If you come from another programming

6
00:00:09,349 --> 00:00:14,070
background, and that's most likely going

7
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:18,480
to be the case, you probably have a

8
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:18,480
pretty good idea on how to do numerous

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,359
things involving classes, and objects. For

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,359
everyone else, and even just as a primer,

11
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:28,529
what we're going to be doing in this

12
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:28,529
video is extending classes and this

13
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:34,410
means we're going to subclass them. So,

14
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:34,410
I'm going to be creating a new

15
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:43,079
class, a couple new classes, that are

16
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:43,079
going to extend the animal class. So, when

17
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:48,870
we think about certain animals,

18
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:48,870
let's say there are distinct differences

19
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:55,410
between a fish and dogs. For instance,

20
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:55,410
dogs can bark, so they obviously have a

21
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:03,780
bark volume. Dogs wear leashes, so there leash must have a color. And fish swim, so

22
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:09,619
they must have a swim speed, for instance. Now, obviously these things could be

23
00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:17,640
processed in a more vague way, and let's

24
00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:17,640
say the speed, the swim speed, could

25
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,909
actually just be called speed because

26
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,909
dogs also have a certain speed that they

27
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:24,090
move at. However, for the sake of this

28
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:24,090
video we're going to be creating two new

29
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:29,159
classes, so let's go ahead and extend the

30
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:29,159
animal class. So how we do that we type

31
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:34,650
the keyword class, so we're creating. The

32
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:34,650
new class is called

33
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:43,189
dog. Now in order to inherit all of this

34
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:43,189
from the animal class, we then put

35
00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:53,700
extends Animal. So there we go. We have a class named dog. Now, I'm getting sick of

36
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,469
these warnings. I'm probably going to try

37
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,469
a different code editor at some point to

38
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:04,590
see if we can get these to go away. So,

39
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:04,590
basically, what we do here is we're going

40
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:09,050
to create a constructor, and it's going

41
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:09,050
to take all the same data and then some.

42
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:14,960
Let's go ahead and create the

43
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:14,960
constructor method. We're going to take

44
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:30,850
name, height, weight, barkVolume, and leashColor. So, at this point in order to

45
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:36,410
instantiate this object as an animal and

46
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:36,410
have access to all these properties and

47
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:41,680
methods that are in the animal class, we

48
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:41,680
need to call what's called a super

49
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:50,900
constructor. How we do that is its

50
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:50,900
keyword you just type in super, and in

51
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:56,330
here essentially it's the same as writing

52
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:56,330
animal. So, we're going to just pass in

53
00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:00,080
the same values that we would pass in to

54
00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:00,080
the animals constructor, which would be

55
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:09,200
name, height, and weight, and this is what

56
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:09,200
I mean by I hate these these lines. It

57
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,180
says Superclass constructor invocation

58
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,180
should be in constructor body. Which is

59
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:21,770
strange because that's exactly where it

60
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:21,770
is. However, I want to make sure

61
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:27,650
that's indented properly. There we go. So

62
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:27,650
then once we get that created, then the

63
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:33,290
dog object that we create has a name,

64
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:33,290
height, and weight, but we're also going

65
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:41,590
to give it a bark volume and leash

66
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:41,590
color. So let's set this.barkVolume

67
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:54,500
equals barkVolume, and then this.leashColor equals leashColor. So, at

68
00:03:54,500 --> 00:04:00,410
this point the dog has a name, a height, a

69
00:03:54,500 --> 00:04:00,410
weight, a bark volume, and a leash color. So,

70
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:06,370
I'm going to create a method here that

71
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:06,370
we're going to be calling, and let's

72
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:17,090
call it bark. What we're going to do

73
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:17,090
is depending on the volume level which

74
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:22,280
is going to be between 0 and 1, actually zero and a hundred that

75
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:27,470
makes it easier, what we're

76
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:27,470
going to do is if it's above a certain

77
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:31,580
amount it's going to bark loudly,

78
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:31,580
otherwise it's going to bark quietly.

79
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:41,650
So, if it's over 50 it's going to be

80
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:41,650
a loud bark. So, if this.barkVolume is

81
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:59,080
over 50 we're going to console.log

82
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:59,080
"BARK BARK!" Instead, let's type "The dog

83
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:17,150
barks...actually, let's use the actual name.

84
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:17,150
So, this.name, "barks loudly!" If it's

85
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:31,850
under 50, we're going to console.log

86
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:31,850
this.name, "barks timidly." There we go. So,

87
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:35,419
now if we save this and refresh our page

88
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:35,419
we shouldn't see any errors, but we also

89
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:39,560
shouldn't see anything happen yet. So we

90
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:39,560
actually need to go create, we need to

91
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:45,860
instantiate the dog, and then the dog

92
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:45,860
object, or the dog class, we'll go back to

93
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:49,880
the animal class and then instantiate

94
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:49,880
that, and then kind of combine them

95
00:05:49,880 --> 00:06:00,880
together. So, var king = new Dog,

96
00:05:49,880 --> 00:06:00,880
we're going to pass in "King" is the name.

97
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,419
Its height, it's a very big dog so we're

98
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,419
going to say it's 45 inches tall.

99
00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:09,380
I'm not sure if that's big or not. It's

100
00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:09,380
going to be 92 pounds. It's going to have

101
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:22,570
a bark volume of 72, and a leash color of

102
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:22,570
red. And in here I'm going to put the

103
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:25,570
volume.

104
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:39,870
This.barkVolume, there. And, I'm just

105
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:39,870
going to copy and paste this into the

106
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:49,860
next line as well, there we go. So, now

107
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:49,860
what I'm going to do is I'm going to say

108
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:57,360
king.bark. I'm going to save this and

109
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:57,360
refresh, and it says King barks loudly! As

110
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:05,400
you can see, the constructor of the

111
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:05,400
the parent class is being invoked here.

112
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:13,410
If I remove this and save it and refresh,

113
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:13,410
as you can see it's giving us an error.

114
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:19,290
So, that's why we need to call the super

115
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:19,290
constructor, and then everything works

116
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:25,980
well. Now, what we're going to do is we're

117
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:25,980
going to go extend the animal class

118
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:36,960
again, so I'm going to say class Fish

119
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:36,960
extends Animal. Now the same thing in

120
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:42,920
here we're going to create a constructor,

121
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:42,920
it's going to take in a name, height,

122
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:54,510
weight, and a swim speed. So, again, we need to call super with the name, height, and

123
00:07:54,510 --> 00:08:07,680
weight, and then we're going to set this.swimSpeed = swimSpeed, and then

124
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:14,400
we're going to create a method here

125
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:14,400
called swim. Now if the swim speed is

126
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:23,610
above 50 he's going to swim around fast,

127
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:23,610
so quickly. So, if this.swimSpeed is

128
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:36,250
higher than 50, we're going to

129
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:36,250
console.log the name. So this.name "swim

130
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:48,100
was around quickly!" Speed is going to be

131
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:48,100
this.swimSpeed, and then we're

132
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:59,530
going to close that. If it's not about 50,

133
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:59,530
we're going to console.log this.name, so

134
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:07,900
it's going to print out the the fish's

135
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:07,900
name, comma "swims around slowly." And we're

136
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:13,750
going to say speed is going to be

137
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:13,750
equal to this.swimSpeed, and we're going to

138
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:20,980
print that out here. No, I can't use plus

139
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:20,980
signs because that's going to try...oh, yeah,

140
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:26,170
I can. Okay, this should work.

141
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:26,170
I've been working in Python a lot

142
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:33,610
lately. So, what we're going to do now is

143
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:33,610
we're going to create Goldie, it's going

144
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:40,180
to equal two new Fish. The name is going

145
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:40,180
to be Goldie, the height is going to be 2

146
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:46,000
inches, weight is going to be .1

147
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:46,000
pounds, I'm not sure if that's reasonable,

148
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:53,440
and the swim speed is going to be 43. And then under the dog barking, the dog

149
00:09:53,440 --> 00:10:00,490
barking is going to scare the fish, so

150
00:09:53,440 --> 00:10:00,490
Goldie is going to swim. Let's save this

151
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:07,150
and refresh, and as you can see it says

152
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:07,150
created animal, created animal, then King

153
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:14,200
barks loudly, volume 72, and Goldie swims around slowly. Now we can give

154
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,790
Goldie a better chance of surviving if

155
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,790
we make them swim around quickly, so

156
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:28,600
let's go ahead and change the swim speed to 77. Save it and refresh, there we go. So,

157
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:36,010
what we're going to do is we're going to,

158
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:36,010
we're going to kind of do a calculation

159
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:48,130
here, and if the swim, or if the

160
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:48,130
fish swims quicker the dog is able

161
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:50,600
to run and we're going to determine that based

162
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:57,710
on their size, so 45. So we're just going

163
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:57,710
to do a simple comparison here. So in the

164
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:08,050
swim method we're going to pass in king.height, and then in here we say

165
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:17,270
chaserHeight is what we're going to

166
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:17,270
pass in there, and if this.swimSpeed

167
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:27,080
is greater than chaserHeight...actually,

168
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:27,080
you know let's use speed, let's give the

169
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:34,280
dog speed too. Okay, so he has leash color and speed, and then this.speed is

170
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:40,490
going to be equal to speed. So we're

171
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:40,490
going to come down here and we're going

172
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:53,800
to give the dog a speed of 52, and we're

173
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:53,800
going to say king.speed here. So,

174
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:59,570
change this to chaserSpeed and we're

175
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:59,570
just going to compare the two speeds. So,

176
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:10,720
if this.speed is greater than, sorry

177
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:10,720
this.swimSpeed it's greater than chaserSpeed,

178
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:32,240
we console.log the name. So this

179
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:32,240
name "got away!" Else, I'm going to console.log "was

180
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:41,700
caught!" Alright, so let's

181
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:41,700
save, let's go ahead and refresh, what we

182
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:50,040
should have now is a method that says

183
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:50,040
Goldie got away. Alright, so King barks

184
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:55,800
loudly, Goldie swims around quickly, and

185
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:55,800
Goldie got away. Now, if we change the

186
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:04,760
speed to less than the dog's speed, so

187
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:04,760
46, I'm going to save it and refresh, and

188
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:12,680
because Goldie swims around slowly he is caught. So that was a neat little

189
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:19,230
minigame kind of thing, or a little program

190
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:19,230
that we built, that was fun.

191
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:23,820
But, as you can see, we can extend the

192
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:23,820
animals, we can extend any class really,

193
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:30,600
we could even extend dog and create a,

194
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:30,600
you know, Labrador if we wanted to. You

195
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:35,960
can continue extending classes

196
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:35,960
and subclasses however far you want. So,

197
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:40,550
that was how to extend classes.
